# tic_tac_toe
These are various versions of tic-tac-toe in different programming languages:

1 - pyhotn_visual (Time of development: 06/2021)

This version can be played by 1 or 2 people. Each move is visualized using tkinter.
For a single-player game, there are 3 difficulty levels:
    1) the opponent moves randomly
    2) the first few moves are strategic, the rest are random
    3) most moves are strategic

2 - cpp_text (Time of development: 01/2024)

This is an extremely simple two-player tic-tac-toe game. The moves are visualized with text (x, ., or o), and the user inputs which row and column they want to place x or o in.
